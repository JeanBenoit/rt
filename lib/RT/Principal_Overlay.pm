# {{{ sub _CleanupInvalidDelegations

Revokes all ACE entries delegated by this principal which are
inconsistent with this principal's current delegation rights.  Does
not perform permission checks, but takes no action and returns success
if this principal still retains DelegateRights.  Should only ever be
called from inside the RT library.

If this principal is a group, recursively calls this method on each
cached user member of itself.

If called from inside a transaction, specify a true value for the
InsideTransaction parameter.

Returns a true value if the deletion succeeded; returns a false value
and logs an internal error if the deletion fails (should not happen).

# {{{ sub HasRight

=head2 sub HasRight (Right => 'right' Object => undef)


Checks to see whether this principal has the right "Right" for the Object
specified. If the Object parameter is omitted, checks to see whether the 
user has the right globally.

This still hard codes to check to see if a user has queue-level rights
if we ask about a specific ticket.


This takes the params:

    Right => name of a right

    And either:

    Object => an RT style object (->id will get its id)


Returns 1 if a matching ACE was found.

Returns undef if no ACE was found.
