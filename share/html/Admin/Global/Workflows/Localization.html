<&|/l&>Status values stored in the DB are limitted to ASCII. To localize values you have to change po-files. Copy text block below, insert it into a local po file for language you want to localize into and translate. If you don't have local po files then you can borrow a header from RT's core po files. Don't change general po files as those are over written on every update.</&>
